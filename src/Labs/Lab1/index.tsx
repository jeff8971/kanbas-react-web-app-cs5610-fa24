        <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
        Text documents are often broken up into several sections and
        subsections. Each section is usually prefaced with a short
        title or heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the
        section it precedes. For instance this paragraph is preceded by
        the heading Heading Tags. The font of the section headings are
        usually larger and bolder than their subsection headings. This
        document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML
        Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags can
        be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as
        large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different sizes:
        h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and
        h6 is the smallest heading.

        <h4>Paragraph Tag</h4>

        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
        vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
        This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
        gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
        browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
        the right.
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
        tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
